A simple console-based coffee machine simulation implemented in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Overview

This Python script simulates the operation of a coffee machine. Users can choose from a menu of drinks, request a report on the machine's resources, and turn off the machine. The implementation utilizes classes such as `CoffeeMaker`, `MoneyMachine`, and `Menu` to encapsulate the machine's functionality and provide a modular structure.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akumarm23/Day16-Coffee-OOP.git
   cd Day16-Coffee-OOP
   ```
2. **Run the Coffee Machine:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Run the script, and you'll be prompted to select a drink from the menu.
- Type "off" to turn off the coffee machine.
- Type "report" to generate a report on the machine's resources.

## Dependencies

- [art](https://pypi.org/project/art/): ASCII art library for displaying the coffee machine logo.
